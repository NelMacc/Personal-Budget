Build envelopes for budgeting
Each envelope holds a certain amount of money for use on bills, groceries, entertainment
Once you run out of money in the envelope youre out

make three pages bills.js, groceries.js and entertainment.js
give the user access to how much money they want to put into each envelope
give the user access to add in the amount theyve spent on things within those envelopes
the money theyve spent should be taken away from the amount they put in

for instance if the entertainment envelope has $100(category_budget) in it the amount theyve spent(expense) will be subtracted from that
$100(category_budget)
$37(expense)
$21(expense)

$42 left(category_budget)
(category_budget) will be replaced with the specific category, entertainment would be (entertainment_budget)
